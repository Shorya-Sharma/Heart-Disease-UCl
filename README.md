This repo is based on Kaggle competition hosted 3 years ago titled as 'Heart Disease UCl'. The database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. I've implemented a feedforward neural network architecture in Pytoch Deep Learning Framework to solve this classification problem. The neural architecture consists of 3 hidden layers and Relu is used as the activation function. I haven't used drop-out or batch normalization methods in this project to avoid overfitting
